                        <h1>Page Correction</h1> <br> Prior to publishing the accepted article, generally, page proofs will be sent to the author for correction, and a deadline will be given in returning such proofs.<br><br> If the author fails to meet the
                        deadline, the editors have the rights to publish such article without authors correction. The corresponding author will receive an email alert containing a link to a web site. A working e-mail address must therefore be provided
                        for the corresponding author.<br><br> The proof can be downloaded as a PDF (portable document format) file from this site. Acrobat Reader will be required in order to read this file. This software can be downloaded (free of charge)
                        from the website of the journal.<br>
                        <br> This will enable the file to be opened, read on screen and printed out in order for any corrections to be added.<br> Further instructions will be sent with the proof. Hard copy proofs will be posted if no e-mail address is
                        available.<br> Excessive changes made by the author in the proofs, excluding typesetting errors, will be charged separately.<br>
