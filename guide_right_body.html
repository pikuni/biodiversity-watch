                        <h1>Author Guidelines</h1>
                        <strong>Scope</strong><br /> The themes of the submitted article should be on forest governance, policy and programs on Biodiversity Conservation, conservation of medicinal plants and mainstreaming traditional knowledge into protection
                        of biodiversity. Original research articles are invited on specific thematic area of forest governance and biodiversity conservation. The spectrum is very broad. It covers a wide range of issues relating to research on Biodiversity
                        Conservation and forest governance.<br />
                        <strong>Procedure for submission of article</strong><br /> The language of the article should be written in English. All portions of the manuscript must be typed double-spaced and all pages numbered starting from the title page.<br
                        /> The Title should be a brief phrase describing the contents of the paper. The Title Page should include the authors' full names and affiliations, the name of the corresponding author along with phone, fax and E-mail information.
                        Present addresses of authors should appear as a footnote.<br /> The Abstract should be informative and completely self-explanatory, briefly present the topic, state the scope of the experiments, indicate significant data, and point
                        out major findings and conclusions. The abstract should be 100 to 200 words in length. Complete sentences, active verbs, and the third person should be used, and the abstract should be written in the past tense. Standard nomenclature
                        should be used and abbreviations should be avoided. No literature should be cited.<br /> Following the abstract, about 3 to 10 key words that will provide indexing references should be listed.<br /> A list of non-standard Abbreviations
                        should be added. In general, non-standard abbreviations should be used only when the full term is very long and used often. Each abbreviation should be spelt out and introduced in parentheses the first time it is used in the text.
                        Authors should use the solidus presentation (mg/ml). Standard abbreviations need not be defined.<br /> The Introductionshould provide a clear statement of the problem, the relevant literature on the subject, and the proposed approach
                        or solution. It should be understandable to colleagues from a broad range of scientific disciplines.<br /> Materials and Methods should be complete enough to allow experiments to be reproduced. However, only truly new procedures
                        should be described in detail; previously published procedures should be cited, and important modifications of published procedures should be mentioned briefly. Capitalize trade names and include the manufacturer's name and address.
                        Subheadings should be used. Methods in general use need not be described in detail.<br /> Findings should be presented with clarity and precision. The results should be written in the past tense when describing findings in the
                        author(s)' experiments. Previously published findings should be written in the present tense. Results should be explained, but largely without referring to the literature. Discussion, speculation and detailed interpretation of
                        data should not be included in the results but should be put into the discussion section.<br /> TheObservations should interpret the findings in view of the results obtained in this and in past studies on this topic. State the
                        conclusions in a few sentences at the end of the paper. The Results and Discussion sections can include subheadings, and when appropriate, both sections can be combined.<br /> The Acknowledgement of people, grants, funds, etc should
                        be in brief.<br /> Tables should be kept to a minimum and be designed to be as simple as possible. Tables are to be typed double-spaced throughout, including headings and footnotes. Each table should be on a separate page, numbered
                        consecutively in Arabic numerals and supplied with a heading and a legend. Tables should be self-explanatory without reference to the text. The details of the methods used in the experiments should preferably be described in the
                        legend instead of in the text. The same data should not be presented in both table and graph forms or repeated in the text.<br /> Figure legendsshould be typed in numerical order on a separate sheet. Graphics should be prepared
                        using applications capable of generating high resolution GIF, TIFF, JPEG or PowerPoint before pasting in the Microsoft Word manuscript file. Tables should be prepared in Microsoft Word. Use Arabic numerals to designate figures
                        and upper case letters for their parts (Figure 1). Begin each legend with a title and include sufficient description so that the figure is understandable without reading the text of the manuscript. Information given in legends
                        should not be repeated in the text.<br />
                        <strong>References:</strong> In the text, a reference identified by means of an author&lsquo;s name should be followed by the date of the reference in parentheses. When there are more than two authors, only the first author&lsquo;s
                        name should be mentioned, followed by &rsquo;et al&lsquo;. In the event that an author cited has had two or more works published during the same year, the reference, both in the text and in the reference list, should be identified
                        by a lower case letter like &rsquo;a&lsquo; and &rsquo;b&lsquo; after the date to distinguish the works. References should be mentioned directly in the text using &ldquo;(Last-name Year)&rdquo;. If the authors are more than three,
                        use &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;; for instance: (Tewari, K., et al. 2007). Add page number for references with citation, for example: (Stella, J. 2007:114).<br />
